# Animated Marble Race Random Number Generator

This project is an interactive web application that simulates an animated marble race, demonstrating random number generation in a visually engaging way. Built with Astro and Phaser, it provides a fun and dynamic visualization of random outcomes.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Animated Marble Race**: Watch marbles race to the finish line with smooth animations.
*   **Random Number Generation**: The race outcomes are driven by random numbers, showcasing their application in a game context.
*   **Interactive Visualization**: A compelling way to visualize probabilistic events.
*   **Modern Web Stack**: Leverages Astro for fast content delivery and Phaser for game rendering.

## üöÄ Project Structure

*   `public/`: Contains static assets like images (`marble.png`).
*   `src/components/`: Houses Astro/React components, including `MarbleRace.tsx` which integrates the Phaser game.
*   `src/constants/`: Defines game-related constants.
*   `src/pages/`: Astro pages, with `index.astro` serving as the main entry point.
*   `src/phaser/`: Contains Phaser game logic, including `gameConfig.ts` and `RaceScene.ts`.
*   `src/styles/`: Stores styling information for the application.
*   `src/utils/`: Utility functions, potentially including mathematical or random number generation helpers.
